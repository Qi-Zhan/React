# REACT

This is a replication package for ASE'24 paper "IR level Patch Presence Test for Binary".

## Requirements

### Environment

- llvm@14
- Rust

### Dataset

Download the dataset from [here](https://figshare.com/s/77da6a3ec24d20540dad), unzip.
Make sure your directory structure is the same as below.

```text
.
├── README.md (you are here)
├── Cargo.toml
├── react (entry point)
├── ir-analysis (LLVM IR analysis)
├── source-analysis (parse diff file)
└── dataset (** which you should put the dataset here **)
```

## Run

It is super easy to replicate the experimental results. Just run the following command in the current directory.

```bash
cargo run --release
```

You will get the results in stdout. `log.txt` contains test results for each CVE-bitcode pair.

> You may encounter an error from `llvm-sys` crate, you may fix it by setting `LLVM_SYS_140_PREFIX` to the llvm@14 path.

### File Name Format

The target file name format is `filename_version_optimization_compiler`. For example, `ffmpeg_n4.0_O0_x86_clang` is a bitcode file generated by RetDec.

The reference file name format is `cvenumber_state`. For example, `CVE-2018-0734_vuln` is a vulnerable bitcode file for the CVE. The `state` can be `vuln` or `patch`, which means the patch file is generated by the commit that fixes the CVE.
